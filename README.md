# Coding Practice Journey 🚀

This repo documents my coding journey through **Codility, HackerRank, and Codewars**.  
The goal is to improve my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

## Platforms
- [Codility](https://app.codility.com/programmers/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)

## Folder Structure
- `codility/` → Organized by lessons
- `hackerrank/` → Organized by categories (Warmup, Algorithms, Data Structures)
- `codewars/` → Organized by kata level (8kyu → 1kyu)

## Progress Log
- ✅ Codility Lesson 1: Binary Gap
- ✅ HackerRank: Solve Me First
- ✅ Codewars: Even or Odd (8kyu)
- ⏳ Codility Lesson 2: Cyclic Rotation
